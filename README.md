# Distinctiveness and Complexity

This , the project “Trip Distributor” , is created as the aim to divide the spending while on group trip. This issue of unequal spending as been faced by many groups around the world , might its every time we went for it , as one might think he had spent a lot like on every group travelling amount to pay is been managed him and others had gave less ; this , further , become emotional stress and might dispute in relations and it seems the main reason that people has reduce to move on group trips .Even it gives lots of enjoyable moments , but it also might be financial burden for them .

To the solution for it , I have created a webapp which allows user to register themselves and host the trip with inviting others to the trip where further they can add the amount they spend on particular time with the description where they spend and that will ,then, calculate spending per user , total of trip and equal distribution of it per users subtracting there spending from total user shares and this will help users to “distribute trip” when trip ends. 

This webapp provides users to register themselves with distinct username. After login , user will see the main , index, page where they can see notification center , where Other users send them request to join a trip as by doing such no other user will able to add others on their trip without permission . After which , Current trip sections will provide user the List of the trips they are currently on with its name and date of starting trip ; further after it webapp is joined to history of the trips they went and spend , that will be most helpful if the situation occurs to go through history .

For hosting trip , user have to click on the ADD TRIP button on navigation bar , where you can see a form where you can name the trip and before starting trip , don’t forgot to add user you want to sent request by there username , you can do so by adding typing username ( other then yours , you will be automatically added) you want to join and press on add button , and which will add user to list just below , if username is correct ; even you can remove that user from list by remove button . And after your list of users is ready , press “LET’S GO” to Start Trip and sent requests to users.

Then requested users will be show request by name of trip and user to host with the options to accept or reject. And app will work as per your command. If you accept it your current trip list will be append with this trip or if you reject its notification will be removed.

On the Current trip or History Trip sections on the index page, you will find the name of the trips you are on or went, by clicking on that, browser will be redirected to the that trip page where you will find all information about trip and if you are host or your trip is ended you can end or delete trip by the button beside “status” section respectively. After which , you will find a form where you can add the spending (on current trip ), which is main purpose of this webapp , you can add it by filling where you spent and amount ; the table after that you will find the user’s username with the amount they spend and the distributed amount they have to provide; if it is in negative they have to provide that sum or  if in positive they have to fill their pocket with that sum as they have spent more. And the last section will Provide you the elaborated background of all the spending with First Name of user, their spend, where they spend that, and date and time of that spend.
